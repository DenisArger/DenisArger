# Denis Arger

Backend / Automation / AI Integrations Engineer

I build practical systems around Telegram bots, serverless backends, integrations (Notion, Google, Supabase), and automation workflows.

## Impact

- 21 public repositories actively maintained
- 13 core repositories updated in one standardization wave (README + LICENSE + topics)
- Multi-stack delivery across Node.js/TypeScript and Python projects
- Production-focused patterns: CI, safer docs/configs, and deployment-ready repositories
- Latest CI run status across key repositories: passing
- Quality baseline established: README + LICENSE + lint + test + CI for active projects
